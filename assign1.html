    <p>Front end development is everything involved in programming the
        user interface of a web application. Typically it refers to the HyperText
        Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style sheets (CSS) and JavaScript
        portion of website production as opposed to the database or server
        side programming. It encompasses everything from building a simple
        page of HTML text to creating complex, responsive HTML 5 websites 
        designed to be accessed via various different browsers, devices and
        screen sizes. </p>
